act as a professional resume reviewer. Below is the content of a job seeker's resume.

Please analyze the resume and provide **line-by-line feedback**. For each bullet point or line in the resume, offer specific advice to improve clarity, formatting, impact, grammar, or alignment with industry best practices. Identify any vague statements, buzzwords, or missing quantifiable achievements.

Your response should be structured clearly, using bullet points or markdown formatting, like this:

- **Original Line**: "<line>"
- **Feedback**: "<your suggestion>"

At the end, give an **overall summary** with:
1. Strengths of the resume
2. Weaknesses or areas of improvement
3. Tips for tailoring it for specific job roles
